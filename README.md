## Project Proposal: Retail Trade Turnover Analysis
## Project Title:
Forecasting Retail Trade Turnover using Machine Learning

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that forecasts retail trade turnover across various categories (Food retailing, Household goods retailing, Clothing, Department stores, and Cafes/Restaurants). This will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation based on expected turnover trends.

Machine Learning Problems Addressed:
Sales Forecasting: Predict future turnover for each retail category based on historical data.
Trend Analysis: Identify trends and seasonality in turnover data to help businesses understand market dynamics.

Machine Learning Algorithms:
Time Series Forecasting Models:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Suitable for univariate time series data.
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Incorporates seasonality in the data, making it suitable for retail turnover which often exhibits seasonal patterns.
Regression Models:

Linear Regression: To explore relationships between different categories of turnover and predict future values.
Random Forest Regression: Can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively.

Data Preprocessing Steps:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Create lag features and moving averages to enhance predictive power.
Normalization/Scaling: Normalize turnover values for better model performance.

Agile Process for 2 Weeks:
Sprint 1 (Week 1):

Day 1-2: Data Collection and Exploration
Gather and inspect the dataset.
Understand data structure and distribution.

Day 3-4: Data Preprocessing
Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates).
Perform feature engineering (create relevant features).

Day 5: Model Selection
Decide on the forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Sprint 2 (Week 2):

Day 6-7: Model Training

Train selected models on the training dataset.
Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation.

Day 8: Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Compare results from different models.

Day 9: Insights and Visualization
Visualize trends and forecasts.
Generate reports for stakeholders.

Day 10: Review and Next Steps
Present findings to stakeholders.
Gather feedback and discuss potential next steps for deployment or further analysis.

Conclusion:
By implementing this project, we aim to create a robust forecasting model that helps stakeholders understand retail turnover trends. This will enhance decision-making processes and optimize retail strategies. The agile process will ensure timely delivery and adaptability based on feedback throughout the two-week project timeline.
